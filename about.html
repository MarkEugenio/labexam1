            Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Mark Richard Eugenio, and
            I am 19 years old. I live in Bangad Paradise Cabanatuan City and I 
            love doing things that challenge me the most; that's why I chose
            to be a programmer because it is one of the most challenging
            courses where you really need to put a lot of effort into it.</pre>

        <h2 class="par_2">MY AMBITION IN LIFE</h2>
        <pre class="paragraph_2">
            My IT ambition in life is to have a strong desire on doing 
            things that I want to achieve, and have more knowledge 
            about the things that I want to learn which is coding.
            I always want to challenge myself on the things that I know
            That will be worth for me and the BSIT is one and only courses
            that I think it will be suit for me and I will do my best to
            be one of the best programmer in the Philippines.</pre>
